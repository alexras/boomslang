# About Boomslang

I created Boomslang to decrease the amount of boilerplate code I had to write
when producing graphs for research papers. Boomslang treats data and plots
separately and encapsulates them both in objects, giving the programmer the
ability to author modular, re-usable graphing code.


# Downloading Boomslang

The current stable version of Boomslang is [0.6
beta](https://github.com/downloads/alexras/boomslang/boomslang-0.6b.tar.gz). For
a list of new features and bug fixes in this version, check the changelog in
the wiki.

Boomslang requires `matplotlib`. You can get it at [their GitHub
page](http://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) or install it through your
favorite package management utility like pip.

Since the rate of churn of Boomslang's feature set is still pretty high, I
recommend that people use Boomslang by checking out a read-only copy of the
repository.

it there. Then, ask the mailing list or ask me directly.
