Introduction to Boomslang
=========================

I created Boomslang to decrease the amount of boilerplate code I had to write
when producing plots for research papers. Boomslang treats both plots and plot
data as objects. This allows functions to return plot data or plots, and allows
plots to be flexibly and cleanly composed. Boomslang also abstracts away much
of Matplotlib's syntax, which can be confusing and brittle if not used
properly.
