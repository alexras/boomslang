boomslang:
A thin layer over matplotlib that simplifies creation of common plots


About Boomslang
---------------
I created Boomslang to decrease the amount of boilerplate code I had to write
when producing graphs for research papers. Boomslang treats data and plots
separately and encapsulates them both in objects, giving the programmer the
ability to author modular, re-usable graphing code.


Downloading Boomslang
---------------------
The current stable version of Boomslang is 0.4 beta:
http://boomslang.googlecode.com/files/boomslang-0.4b.tar.gz. For a list of new
features and bug fixes in this version, check the change log.

Boomslang requires matplotlib. You can get it here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-0.99.1/
or install it through your favorite package management utility

Since the rate of churn of Boomslang's feature set is still quite high, I
recommend that people use Boomslang by checking out the Mercurial repository:

hg clone https://boomslang.googlecode.com/hg boomslang

it there. Then, ask the mailing list or ask me.
